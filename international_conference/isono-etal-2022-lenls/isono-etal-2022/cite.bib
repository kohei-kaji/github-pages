  abstract  = {We present a formalization of the constructivist analysis of argument structure in Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). According to the constructivist analysis, often couched in terms of Distributed Morphology (DM), arguments are introduced in the syntax rather than specified by the lexical argument structure of the verb. We argue that formalizing constructivism in CCG not only provides the basis for a model of incremental processing of argument structure but also a principled account for the locality constraints on contextual allomorphy observed in the DM literature.},
